- DataTable field doesn't preserve checked value correctly if other
  fields don't validate (id gets set to 1 for all rows, and all boxes
  are checked).
- Modal needs more flexible width. It breaks when making screen narrower
  than 816px, and if no DataTable field is there, it can be narrower also.
